## Features and functionality ðŸ§°

  

### Authentication

* Authentication with the use of Firebase Authentication

* Each user is stored in the Firebase backend, with their email and date for registration

  

### Upload artwork

* Navigate to the Profile page, and find the image from your device, enter a title and description. **NOTE!** You will not be able to upload an image without filling in all three items (image, title, description)

* Wait for 2-3 seconds, and (if successful) the image will get uploaded into the Firebase Storage / Firestore database, and be available for viewing on the Home page

  

### View artworks

* All the uploads will be available from on the Home page. Press the artwork you would like to learn more about.

* Should the uploader like to delete the post, they can do so by pressing the "Delete post"-button. An alert will appear, notifying the user of the successful deletion of the post, and they will be redirected to the Home-page. **NOTE!** The deletion will also delete the post from Firebase, meaning it will not be able to recover the deleted post, should the user regret the decision.
